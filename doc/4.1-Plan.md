# CS 1440 Project 4.1: Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `4.1-analyzed`)

In this project, I need to refactor the fractal program from Project 4.0 using object-oriented design principles. The main requirements are:

1. Implement the Strategy design pattern for fractal algorithms and color palettes
2. Implement the Factory Method pattern to create fractal and palette objects
3. Create a unified fractal configuration parser
4. Support at least 4 fractal types (Mandelbrot, Julia, etc.)
5. Support at least 5 color palettes
6. Create a comprehensive user manual
7. Write at least 10 meaningful unit tests

The problem this program aims to solve is generating fractal images based on mathematical formulas. A good solution will:
- Have a clean, object-oriented design
- Be extensible (easy to add new fractal types and color palettes)
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide a consistent user interface

I already know how to:
- Create classes and implement inheritance
- Use the Strategy and Factory Method patterns
- Parse configuration files
- Generate fractal images using mathematical formulas

Challenges I foresee:
- Designing a clean class hierarchy for fractals and palettes
- Ensuring the factory methods create the right objects
- Making sure all fractal algorithms work correctly
- Creating a unified parser that works with all fractal types

The program uses data from:
- Fractal configuration files (.frac) that specify parameters like centerX, centerY, axisLength, etc.
- Color palette definitions (either built-in or specified by the user)

The program's output will be:
- Fractal images displayed on screen
- PNG image files saved to disk
- Status messages in the console showing rendering progress

### Parser Function

\`\`\`
parse(fname)
  - Open and read fractal configuration file
  - Parse key-value pairs
  - Handle comments and empty lines
  - Return: Dictionary with fractal parameters
\`\`\`

### Main Function

\`\`\`
main()
  - Parse command line arguments
  - Create fractal object using fractal_factory
  - Create palette object using palette_factory
  - Create ImagePainter and render fractal
\`\`\`

### Error Handling

- For invalid fractal files: Raise FileNotFoundError
- For missing required parameters: Raise RuntimeError
- For invalid parameter values: Raise ValueError
- For unsupported fractal types: Raise NotImplementedError
- For unsupported palette names: Raise NotImplementedError

## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.1-implemented`)

I implemented the code according to the design in Phase 1. Here are some interesting events that happened:

1. I initially forgot to implement the `__len__` method in the Palette class, which caused errors when trying to iterate over the palette.

2. I had trouble with the Phoenix fractal algorithm at first. I had to carefully study the original code to understand how it worked, especially the part about keeping track of the previous z value.

3. I realized that the fractal_factory function was getting too complex with all the parameter conversion and validation. I considered moving some of this logic into the fractal classes themselves but decided to keep it in the factory for now.

4. I had to make sure that the color palettes had enough colors for the number of iterations. If a palette had fewer colors than iterations, I repeated the palette to ensure there were enough colors.

5. I initially forgot to handle case-insensitivity in the parser, which caused issues when testing with files that had mixed-case property names.

My commit history shows my implementation process:

- "Merge remote-tracking branch 'old-origin/erik-starter'" (3 hours ago): Started by merging in the starter code
- "starting fresh from Erik's solution" (3 hours ago): Decided to use the provided starter code as a base
- "fresh start again because it doesnt look right" (2 hours ago): Had to restart implementation after noticing issues
- "remove extra files" (2 hours ago): Cleaned up unnecessary files from the project
- "test" (2 hours ago): Initial testing of the implementation

### Bugs and Fixes

1. **Bug**: The Julia fractal wasn't rendering correctly - it was showing a blank image.
   - Cause: I forgot to convert the creal and cimag parameters to float in the Julia class.
   - Fix: Added explicit float conversion in the count method.

2. **Bug**: The program crashed when trying to use a palette with fewer colors than iterations.
   - Cause: The get_color method was trying to access an index beyond the palette's length.
   - Fix: Modified the get_color method to use modulo arithmetic (n % len(self.colors)).

3. **Bug**: The progress bar wasn't updating correctly.
   - Cause: The _status_bar method was calculating the percentage incorrectly.
   - Fix: Fixed the calculation to properly show progress from 0% to 100%.

4. **Bug**: The program wasn't handling case-insensitive property names in fractal files.
   - Cause: The parser was using exact key matching instead of case-insensitive matching.
   - Fix: Modified the parser to convert all keys to lowercase before storing them.

My commit history shows my testing process:
- "most test cases work" (1 hour ago): Made progress with test cases, but still had some issues
- "colors and tests cases finished" (12 minutes ago): Completed all test cases and fixed color palette issues

## Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `4.1-deployed`)

I've completed the implementation and testing of the program. All required files are present in the correct locations:

- src/
  - fractal.py (abstract Fractal class)
  - mandelbrot.py (Mandelbrot, MandelbrotPow3, MandelbrotPow4 classes)
  - julia.py (Julia class)
  - phoenix.py (Phoenix class)
  - palette.py (abstract Palette class)
  - palettes/ (concrete Palette classes)
  - parser.py (unified parser)
  - fractalfactory.py (fractal factory)
  - palettefactory.py (palette factory)
  - image.py (ImagePainter class)
  - main.py (main function)
  - tests/ (unit tests)
- doc/
  - Manual.md (user manual)
  - Signature.md (sprint signature)
  - CodeSmells4.1.md (code smells report)
  - 4.1-plan.md (this plan)
- run_tests.py (test runner)

I've verified that the program runs correctly from the command line and that all tests pass. I've also checked that the documentation is complete and accurate.

## Phase 5: Maintenance

### What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?

The fractal_factory function is a bit complex and handles too many responsibilities. It parses the file, converts parameters, and creates the appropriate fractal object. This could be split into smaller functions to make it more maintainable.

I'm not entirely sure why the Phoenix fractal algorithm works the way it does. I copied the formula from the original code, but I don't fully understand the mathematics behind it.

If a bug is reported in a few months, it might take me a day or two to find the cause, especially if it's related to the fractal algorithms or parameter handling.

### Will your documentation make sense to...

...anybody besides yourself? I think the user manual is clear and provides good examples, but someone unfamiliar with fractals might still find it challenging to understand all the parameters.

...yourself in six month's time? Probably, but I might need to refresh my memory on the fractal algorithms and how the Strategy pattern is implemented.

### How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?

Adding a new fractal type or color palette should be relatively easy thanks to the object-oriented design. I would just need to create a new class that extends Fractal or Palette and add it to the appropriate factory function.

Adding a completely new feature, like saving animations or implementing a GUI, would be more challenging and might require significant changes to the code.

### Will your program continue to work after upgrading...

...your computer's hardware? Yes, the program doesn't rely on specific hardware features.

...the operating system? Probably, as long as Python and Tkinter are available on the new OS.

...to the next version of Python? It should work with future Python versions, but there might be issues if Tkinter or other libraries change significantly.
