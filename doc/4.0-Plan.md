# CS 1440 Project 4.0: Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis
*(20% of your effort)*

**Goals**  
1. Examine the messy original fractal code.  
2. Run the unmodified code to confirm it renders fractal images and saves them to `.png`.  
3. Note any immediate issues (e.g., global variables, magic numbers).

### Tasks and Deliverables

1. **Review Project Requirements**  
   - Read the relevant documents (`4.0-Project_Requirements.md`, `4.0-Instructions.md`, `4.0-Tkinter.md`) to see how `mbrot_fractal.py` (Mandelbrot) and `phoenix_fractal.py` (Phoenix) should behave. 
   - Observed code structure issues and leftover imports.
2. **No Code Changes**  
   - Only studied the code and documented findings in the plan.

## Phase 1: Design
*(30% of your effort)*

**Goals**  
1. Outline the fractal logic (Mandelbrot and Phoenix).  
2. Identify code smells and decide how to address them.  
3. Document how the user currently runs `mbrot_fractal.py` and `phoenix_fractal.py`.

### Tasks and Deliverables

1. **Pseudocode for Each Fractal**  
   - **Mandelbrot**:
     ```
     z = 0
     for i in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
       z = z*z + c
       if abs(z) > 2:
         return i
     return MAX_ITERATIONS - 1
     ```
   - **Phoenix**:
     ```
     z_prev = 0
     for i in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
       z_next = z*z + c + (pConst * z_prev)
       z_prev = z
       z = z_next
       if abs(z) > 2:
         return i
     return MAX_ITERATIONS - 1
     ```
2. **Identify Smells**  
   - Listed global variables, questionable naming, magic numbers, etc.
3. **Draft User Interaction**  
   - E.g.: `python src/mbrot_fractal.py fractal_file.frac` or `python src/phoenix_fractal.py fractal_file.frac`
   - Summarized expected console output and error messages.

---

## Phase 2: Implementation
*(15% of your effort)*

**Goals**  
1. **Refactor** `mbrot_fractal.py` and `phoenix_fractal.py` to remove code smells.  
2. Keep outward behavior the same.

### Tasks and Deliverables

1. **Refactor**  
   - Eliminated global variables by passing them as parameters.  
   - Updated questionable identifier names.  
   - Removed dead code, e.g. lines after a `return`, or leftover debug imports.
---

## Phase 3: Testing and Debugging
*(30% of your effort)*

**Goals**  
1. Thoroughly test final versions of both fractal scripts from the command line.  
2. Ensure no hidden regressions.

---

## Phase 4: Deployment
*(5% of your effort)*

**Goals**  
1. Wrap up the project in a complete, tested state.

### Tasks and Deliverables

1. **Review**  
   - Ensured code is final, with no stray `.pyc` or test artifacts.  
   - Re-cloned the repo in a fresh folder and re-ran the fractal scripts successfully.
2. **Done**  
   - Submitted the final repository to GitLab with the single push containing all changes.

---

## Phase 5: Maintenance

**Goals**  
Reflect on leftover complexities or how easily we could extend the program further.

### Tasks and Deliverables

1. **Maintainability**  
   - The possible future confusion might be the advanced math behind the fractals themselves, but the code is otherwise tidied.  
   - Future expansions (like a new fractal or palette) should be easier now that global usage is reduced.
2. **Project Reflection**  
   - No additional changes planned until 4.1
