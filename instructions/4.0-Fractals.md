# CS 1440 Project 4.0: Refactoring - Understanding Fractals

This program is intentionally difficult to understand for two reasons:

0.  The code is messy
1.  Fractals are an esoteric subject

Your goal in this sprint is to merely clean up the code.  You do not need to grasp the big picture to know which lines of code are poorly written.  Nor do you actually need to understand precisely how fractals work to refactor this code.  You can clean up *any* program through trial-and-error if you work slowly and carefully:

0.  Go slow and make gradual changes
1.  Change only one section of code or feature at a time
2.  Use Git to your advantage
    *   Make frequent, small commits
    *   Test your changes before making a commit
    *   Discard your changes when you find a mistake
3.  Thorough testing means running both unit tests *and* integration tests
    *   These programs create PNG images as a side-effect.  Keep copies of these images when you know the program works correctly so you can compare later output to these good specimens.

Nevertheless, this process is challenging for programmers who aren't yet at ease with the program's concept.  If you're in this boat, dive into the rest of this document for clarity.


## The Interactive Fractal Demo

To deepen your understanding of fractals, explore the interactive Mandelbrot program [demo/interactive.py](./demo/interactive.py).  While it isn't much prettier than the starter code, it can help you comprehend the algorithm.

*   A left-click paints a square using the same algorithm as in [src/mbrot_fractal.py](./src/mbrot_fractal.py).  That square's iteration count is also visible.  At the same time the value of the Z parameter is printed to the console for each iteration.
*   A right-click reveals the entire image.

By examining the demo's source code, running it in the debugger, and studying its output, you can gain insights about how our program generates images.

**Note:** `demo/interactive.py` is solely for your exploration and learning; it's *not* part of the project. You do not need to modify, test, or document it.



## Understanding Fractal Algorithms

*   Our program uses the [Escape-Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set) plotting algorithm.  You can think of this as a "paint-by-numbers" algorithm.
*   The points *inside* the cardioid are the Mandelbrot set.
    *   Without taking precautions, the escape-time algorithm gets stuck in an infinite loop inside the Mandelbrot set.
    *   Limiting the number of iterations keeps this from happening.
*   Images of the Mandelbrot visualize the complex plane by associating complex numbers to pixels.
    *   A complex number is an ordered pair of *real* and *imaginary* components.
    *   Each pixel has a pair of coordinates `(X, Y)`.
    *   `X` is associated with the *real* part, as is `Y` to the *imaginary* part of the complex number.
    *   The resulting complex number is named `C` in the Mandelbrot algorithm and `Z` in the Phoenix algorithm.
*   This complex number is fed into a formula that changes it.  The output of the formula is fed back into itself over, and over again.
    *   This process is called *iteration*.
    *   Iteration stops when the value exceeds a certain threshold.
*   The Mandelbrot function is fascinating because sometimes iteration *never* produces values that can exceed the threshold.
    *   Points of the complex plane *within* the cardioid shape belong to the Mandelbrot set; iterating them never ends.
    *   Points *outside* of the cardioid quickly exceed the threshold.
    *   Points along the boundary are where all of the pretty and interesting pictures come from; adjacent pixels can have very different iteration counts.
*   The color of the pixel is chosen by counting iterations.
    *   Because the program only has a finite palette of colors, iteration stops when the last color is reached.


### More Fractal Resources

You can find ideas for new fractal configurations by exploring the Mandelbrot and Phoenix sets online.  You can also compare your program's output with other Mandelbrot and Phoenix set visualizers to make sure that you haven't made any serious mistakes.  You will find that some fractal viewers draw Phoenix fractals that are rotated 90Â° relative to ours.  This is a result of our formula "reflecting" the `Z` parameter.

#### Online Fractal Zoomers

Most of these web sites define their images in `(minX, minY), (maxX, maxY)` coordinates, while our program uses the `(centerX, centerY) + axisLength` scheme.  It is helpful to write a small helper program which converts between the coordinate formats.
